"Learn how to build Xamarin.Forms apps for iOS, Android, and Windows using XAML and C# by building an app from scratch."

## Description

"Xamarin.Forms, a technology from Microsoft, allows us to build cross-platform 
mobile applications that run on Android, iOS, and Windows where we write the 
code once, including the UI code. Writing these UIs is done using XAML. 
In this course, Building Xamarin.Forms Applications with XAML, you'll see 
how you can apply XAML to build mobile applications with Xamarin.Forms for 
the major mobile platforms. First, you'll learn the XAML language and its 
syntax. Next, you'll discover how you can build application UIs using pages, 
layouts, views and lists. Finally, you'll explore how to apply styles to 
simplify UI development. When you're finished with this course, you'll have 
the skills and knowledge of building UIs with XAML for real-world Xamarin.Forms 
applications."
